Zk-ads, is the core of our Zero Proof Ad technology.

This directory houses our demo platform where users can get an inside look into every part of the Zap ecosystem. 

Users can upload advertisments to our Web3Storage system, which will automatically add them to the Zap smart contract, which is built on QuickNode.

Users can also particapte in our democractic Ad voting process, allowing users to give a thumbs up or down and attest to this rating. 

We will incentives user reviews by rewarding them with DAO tokens every time they vote.

Finally, for demonstation purposes we display all of the available ads on the network in real time again loading these from Web3Storage.
