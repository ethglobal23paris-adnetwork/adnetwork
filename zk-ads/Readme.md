# Zk-ads: The Core of our Zero-Knowledge Proof Advertising Technology

Welcome to the Zk-ads repository, the home of our innovative zero-knowledge proof advertising technology. This microservice forms the central hub of the Zap ecosystem and offers a robust platform for users to get a comprehensive understanding of our system's inner workings.

## Features

### Advertisement Uploading

Users can easily upload their advertisements to our Web3Storage system. The system is designed to seamlessly integrate with the Zap smart contract built on QuickNode. Upon successful upload, the advertisements are automatically incorporated into the Zap smart contract, hence becoming part of the network.

### Democratic Ad Voting Process

We are empowering users to shape the advertising landscape by participating in our democratic ad voting process. This process allows users to rate advertisements by giving them a thumbs up or down, thus influencing their visibility and relevance within the Zap ecosystem. Users' attestations to these ratings ensure transparency and foster community engagement.

### Incentivized Reviews

To encourage active participation and uphold the quality of the advertisements, we reward users with DAO tokens each time they vote. This not only stimulates community engagement but also maintains the integrity and relevance of the ads within the network.

### Real-time Ad Display

In our pursuit to maintain utmost transparency, all available ads within the network are displayed in real time. For demonstration purposes and easy accessibility, these ads are loaded directly from Web3Storage. This allows users to witness the dynamic nature of our ecosystem and understand how their involvement shapes the overall advertising environment.
