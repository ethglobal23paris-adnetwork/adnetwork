# Ad Portal: Your Gateway to Efficient Advertisement Upload

Welcome to the Ad Portal repository. This is our microservice for quickly and easily uploading advertisement images and redirect URLs to Web3Storage. This Node endpoint serves as a critical bridge in our ecosystem, providing seamless interaction with the storage system while maintaining data security.

## Features

### Fast and Simple Uploads

With our Ad Portal, advertisers can upload their advertisement images and redirect URLs to Web3Storage with ease. We've streamlined the upload process to make it as quick and intuitive as possible, saving advertisers valuable time and effort.

### Content Identifier (CID) Accessibility

In our continuous endeavor to ensure data security and maintain transparency, access to uploaded content is controlled through Content Identifiers (CIDs). CIDs provide a unique and tamper-proof address to your content, giving you complete control over your data.

### Smart Contract and Backend Endpoint Integration

Our Ad Portal goes beyond mere uploads. The CIDs can be fetched via our smart contract or other backend endpoints. This allows for seamless integration and data accessibility, tying together various facets of our ecosystem.
